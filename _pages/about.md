♫*I am a Computer Engineer with a years of coding experience looking for a new challange.
I am a person who loves to learn new things and push my bounds. 
I always had passion with technology, coding life and the mind - the way of think - behind the working systems. 
There shouldn't be anything that I afraid to do in this life, atleast I die trying.
If you fight you might lose, but if you run you already lost. 
Also, I always try to be precise and trustworthy, I try to be human!*♫
